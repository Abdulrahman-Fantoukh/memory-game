# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

Just open up `index.html` in your browser and play the game!

Click a card to reveal it. Then click another one. If they match, great! Keep going.
If they don't the cards will flip back over. Try to remember what's behind each one!
Once you've matched all the cards, you win! You'll get an alert to tell you how many moves it took,
how long, and what your rating was.

Try for three stars under 30 seconds!
